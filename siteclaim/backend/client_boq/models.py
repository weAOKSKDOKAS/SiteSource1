"""Typed contracts for the client_boq module (pydantic) + the module's own DB tables.

Two things live here:

1. **Pydantic schemas** — the plain-data handoffs between the review and estimate stages,
   mirroring the main app's ``schemas/models.py`` discipline (a stage reads and writes typed
   models, no shared mutable state). Every AI stage's ``target_model`` is one of these, so
   ``llm_client.complete_json`` validates the model's JSON output against a strict schema (the
   consistency mechanism, in place of a temperature knob).

2. **The module's own SQLite tables** (``client_boq_*``) — created lazily with
   ``CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`` from :func:`init_tables`, over a connection from the shared
   ``db.store.get_connection``. Self-contained: ``db/schema.sql`` and ``db/seed.py`` are never
   touched, and no existing table is altered.

Decision-value discipline (the hard constraint): the AI proposes and drafts, never decides. That is
enforced structurally here — the AI's stage-03 target model (:class:`DepartureProposalSet`) has NO
status/verdict field at all, so the model *cannot* write a breach verdict. Deterministic rule code
(``client_boq/rules.py``) and the human approve endpoint are the only writers of a departure's
``status``.
